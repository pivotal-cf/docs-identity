PingOne Cloud is an identity-as-a-service solution that delivers secure single sign-on to SaaS,
legacy and web apps.
This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between PingOne Cloud 
as the Identity Provider (IdP) and <%= vars.product_full %> as the Service Provider (SP).

<%= vars.product_full %> supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All <%= vars.product_short %> communication takes place over SSL.
