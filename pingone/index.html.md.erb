PingOne Cloud is an identity-as-a-service solution that delivers secure single sign-on to SaaS,
legacy and web applications.
This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between PingOne Cloud
as the Identity Provider (IdP) and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry as
the Service Provider (SP).

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

To integrate PingOne Cloud with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), you must have the following:

* PingOne Cloud
* A user with app admin privileges

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  To configure SAML, you must have the Pivotal Single Sign-On service broker
  installed on your PCF deployment.
  You need to create a plan, grant any plan administrators, and specify any
  organizations this plan should be the authentication authority for.
  For help configuring plans, see the <a href="../manage-service-plans.html">Manage Service Plans</a> topic.
