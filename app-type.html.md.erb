title: Choosing an Application Type
---

The **Application Type** you select in the Pivotal Single Sign-On dashboard depends on the type of application and the type of user your application authenticates.

* If your application is trying to access other services or APIs on its own behalf rather than on the userâ€™s behalf, the application must authenticate itself using the Single Sign-On service. Choose the <strong>Service-to-Service App</strong> type. This corresponds to the "Client Credentials" grant type in OAuth.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Service-to-Service App</strong> application type is intended only for highly trusted applications such as company owned and managed applications.

* If your application is authenticating end users, refer to the table below. Find your application type in the first column to determine which **Application Type** to select in the Pivotal SSO dashboard.
