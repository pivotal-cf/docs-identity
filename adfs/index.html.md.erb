Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a standards-based service that securely shares identity information between applications. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between AD FS as the identity provider and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry as the service provider.

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.
