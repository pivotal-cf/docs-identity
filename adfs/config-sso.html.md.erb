This topic describes how to add an Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) external SAML identity provider to your <%= vars.product_full %> service plan.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview
When you integrate ADFS with your deployment, you must configure an ADFS external SAML identity provider with
specific settings.
For information about how to add an external SAML identity provider in general, see [Add a SAML Provider](../configure-external-id.html#config-saml-prov).

To configure an ADFS external SAML identity provider, do the following:

1. [Download Identity Provider Metadata](#download-metadata)
1. [Create a New SAML Identity Provider](#new-id-prov)
1. [Configure Your New Identity Provider](#config-id-prov)

## <a id='download-metadata'></a> Download Identity Provider Metadata

Download the metadata from your Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) server at the following URL:
`https://ADFS-HOSTNAME/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`

## <a id='new-id-prov'></a> Create a New SAML Identity Provider

Follow the steps below to create a new identity provider:

1. Log in to the <%= vars.operator_dash %> at `https://p-identity.SYSTEM-DOMAIN` as a Plan Administrator.

1. Select your plan and click **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown.

  :alt => 'Screenshot of the Plans pane. In the dropdown menu for the plan ADFS PCF SSO,
  the option Manage Identity Providers is highlighted.') %>

1. Click **New Identity Provider** to access configuration options.

  :alt => 'Screenshot of the New Identity Provider Pane.') %>

## <a id='config-id-prov'></a> Configure Your New Identity Provider

Follow the steps below to configure a new identity provider:

1. Enter an identity provider name below **Identity Provider Name**.

1. (Optional) Enter a description under **Identity Provider Description**. This is displayed to space developers when they select an identity provider for their app.

1. Select **SAML 2.0** from the dropdown under **Identity Provider Type**.

1. Click **SAML File Metadata (optional)** and then click **Upload Identity Provider Metadata** to upload the XML metadata that you downloaded from your ADFS server. You do not need to enter a **Identity Provider Metadata URL**.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Uploading the Identity Provider Metadata as an XML file makes you unable to use the <strong>Fetch Metadata</strong> option to update your Identity Provider metadata later. If metadata changes on the Identity Provider side, you will have to manually re-upload them as an updated XML file.</p>

1. Enter the email domains you want to include as a comma-separated list under **Email Domains**.

1. Under **Advanced Settings**, click **Attribute Mappings (optional)**.
1.  Configure **User Attributes** to determine how user attributes are propagated from the ADFS identity provider to <%= vars.product_short %>.
For example, you might want to map ADFS's SAML groups to <%= vars.product_short %>O's `external_groups`. <br>
To map ADFS's SAML groups to <%= vars.product_short %>'s `external_groups`, do the following:

	1. Under **User Schema Attribute**, select **external_groups**.
	2. If you followed the steps in [Create Custom Value Groups](./config-adfs.html#groups), type `groups` under **Attribute Name**.
	An attribute mapping with a customized SAML assertion value looks like this:<br><br>
	<%= image_tag ('../images/customized.png', :alt => 'Screenshot of the User Attributes section.
  In the dropdown menu for User Schema Attribute, external_groups is selected.
  In the field for Attribute Name, the word groups has been entered.') %><br><br>
	If you did not follow the steps in [Create Custom Value Groups](./config-adfs.html#groups), type `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/group` under **Attribute Name**.
	An attribute mapping with a non-customized SAML assertion value looks like this:<br><br>
	<%= image_tag ('../images/non-customized.png', :alt => 'Screenshot of the User Attributes section.
  In the dropdown menu for User Schema Attribute, external_groups is selected.
  In the field for Attribute Name, the http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/Group
  has been entered.') %>

1. Click **Create Identity Provider**.

1. From the identity provider list, click on the name of the ADFS identity provider and then click **Group Whitelist**.

1. Follow the instructions in
[Configure Group Allowlist for an External Identity Provider](../configure-external-id.html#config-allowlist)
to enter the ADFS SAML group names to be propagated in the ID tokens generated by <%= vars.product_short %>.
These SAML groups are now included in the roles claim of the user’s ID token.

1. From the identity provider list, click on the name of the ADFS identity provider and then click **Resource Permissions**.

1. Follow the instructions in [Create or Edit Resource Permissions Mapping](../configure-external-id.html#create-resource-perm) to map the user’s ADFS group memberships to their access token's scopes.
The resource permissions that the SAML groups were mapped to are now included in the scopes claim of the user's access token.
