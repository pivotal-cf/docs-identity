This topic describes how to set up Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as your identity
provider by configuring SAML integration.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

To set up AD FS as your identity provider through SAML integration:



## <a id='adfs'></a> Set up SAML in AD FS

To set up SAML in AD FS:

1. Open the **AD FS Management** console.

1. Click **Add Relying Party Trust...** in the Actions pane.

1. On the Welcome step, click **Start**.


1. Select **Import data about the relying party from a file**, enter the path to the downloaded
service provider metadata, and click **Next**.


1. Enter a name for **Display name** and click **Next**.


1. Leave the default multi-factor authentication selection and click **Next**.


1. Select **Permit all users to access this relying party** and click **Next**.


1. Review your settings and click **Next**.

1. Click **Close** to finish the wizard.

1. The claim rule editor should open by default. If it does not, select your Relying Party Trust and
click **Edit Claim Rules...** in the Actions pane.


## <a id='create-claim-rules'></a> Create Claim Rules

To create two claim rules:

1. Click **Add Rule**.

1. Select **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims** for **Claim rule template** and click **Next**.

1. Enter a **Claim rule name**.

1. Select **Active Directory** for **Attribute store**.

1. Select **E-Mail-Addresses** for **LDAP Attribute** and select **E-mail Address** for **Outgoing Claim Type**.

1. Click **Finish**.


1. Click **Add Rule**.

1. Select **Transform an Incoming Claim** from the **Claim rule template** dropdown and click **Next**.


1. Enter a **Claim rule name**.

1. Select **E-Mail Address** for **Incoming claim type**.

1. Select **Name ID** for **Outgoing claim type**

1. Select **Email** for **Outgoing name ID format**.

1. Click **Finish**.


1. Double-click the new Relying Party Trust to open the properties.

1. Select the **Encryption** tab and click **Remove** to remove the encryption certificate.


1. Select the **Advanced** tab and select the SHA algorithm for the **Secure hash algorithm** that
matches the
[SHA Algorithm configured for <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/auth-sso.html#configure-saml).



## <a id='disable-crl-checks'></a> (Optional) Disable CRL Checks

If you are using a self-signed certificate, disable CRL checks:

1. Open **Windows Powershell** as an admin.

1. Disable the CRL checks by running:
```
set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -TargetName "< Relying Party Trust >" -SigningCertificateRevocationCheck None
```

1. (Optional) If you are using a self-signed certificate, add it to the AD FS trust store. Obtain the
<%= vars.ops_manager %> certificate from `https://OPS_MANAGER_IP/api/v0/security/root_ca_certificate`
and add this CA certificate to the AD FS trust store, so AD FS can trust the "Service Provider Key
Certificate" certificate signed by <%= vars.ops_manager %> ROOT CA.

1. (Optional) To specify any application or group attributes that you want to map to users in the ID
token, click **Edit Claim Rules...** and configure **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims**.
For more information, see the next section.


## <a id='adfs-groups'></a> Set up Groups in SAML from AD FS

To set up groups in SAML from AD FS:

1. Right-click your **Relying Party Trust** and select **Edit Claim Rules...**.


1. Select **Add Rule**.

1. Select **Send Group Membership as a Claim** and click **Next**.


1. Enter the **Claim rule name**.

1. Click **Browse** to select your **User’s group**.

1. Select **Group** as your **Outgoing claim type**.

1. Set your **Outgoing claim value** to match your group’s name.

1. Click **Finish**.


1. To save these configurations and use the default SAML assertion of
`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/Group`,
click **OK**. If you want to pass the claims assertion as a custom value `“groups”` in the SAML
assertion, continue to the [Create Custom Value Groups](#groups) procedure below.


## <a id='groups'></a> Create Custom Value Groups

To create custom value groups:

1. Select your newly created rule and click **Edit Rule**.


1. Click **View Rule Language**.

1. Copy the text in the **Claim rule language** field to a notepad or other location. You need this
text for the next steps.

1. Exit the **Edit Rule** menu. Select the rule you just added and click **Remove Rule**.

1. Click **Add Rule**.

1. Select **Send Claims Using a Custom Rule** from the **Claim rule template** dropdown.

1. Click **Next**.


1. Paste in the text you previously copied in step 3 from the removed rule. Edit the `Type` so that
it only says `“groups”`.


1. Click **OK** to finish making your changes and save the changes you made.
