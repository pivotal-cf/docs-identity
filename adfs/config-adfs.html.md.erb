## <a id='disable-crl-checks'></a> (Optional) Disable CRL Checks

If you are using a self-signed certificate, disable CRL checks:

1. Open **Windows Powershell** as an admin.

1. Disable the CRL checks by running:
```
set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -TargetName "< Relying Party Trust >" -SigningCertificateRevocationCheck None
```

1. (Optional) If you are using a self-signed certificate, add it to the AD FS trust store. Obtain the
<%= vars.ops_manager %> certificate from `https://OPS_MANAGER_IP/api/v0/security/root_ca_certificate`
and add this CA certificate to the AD FS trust store, so AD FS can trust the "Service Provider Key
Certificate" certificate signed by <%= vars.ops_manager %> ROOT CA.

1. (Optional) To specify any application or group attributes that you want to map to users in the ID
token, click **Edit Claim Rules...** and configure **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims**.
