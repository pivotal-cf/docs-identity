    1. (Optional) If you are using a self-signed certificate, disable CRL checks by following these steps:

    1. Open **Windows Powershell** as an Administrator.

    2. Run the following command:

        ```
        set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -TargetName "< Relying Party Trust >" -SigningCertificateRevocationCheck None
        ```

1. (Optional) If you are using a self-signed certificate, add it to the AD FS trust store. Obtain the <%= vars.ops_manager %> certificate from `https://OPS_MANAGER_IP/api/v0/security/root_ca_certificate` and add this CA certificate to the AD FS trust store, so AD FS can trust the "Service Provider Key Certificate" certificate signed by OpsManager ROOT CA.

1. (Optional) To specify any application or group attributes that you want to map to users in the ID token, click **Edit Claim Rules...** and configure **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims**. For more information, see the next section.
