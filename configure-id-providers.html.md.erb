This topic describes how administrators can use an Internal User Store or an external identity provider to manage user access to a Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan.

For each plan, SSO provides an Internal User Store that manages users. As an alternative to the Internal User Store, administrators can use an external identity provider to allow users who are externally managed to access applications.

## <a id='config-int-store'></a> Configure Internal User Store

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your User Account and Authentication (UAA) administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

2. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown menu.

3. Click **Internal User Store**.

4. Enter a **Description**.

5. Under **Password Policy Settings**, select **Use Recommended Settings**, **Use Default Settings**, or enter custom settings in the fields below.

6. Click **Save Identity Provider**.

## <a id='add-to-int'></a> Add Users to the Internal User Store

You cannot add users to Service Plans from the SSO dashboard. In order to add users to the Internal User Store for a given Service Plan, you must use the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC). If you do not already have the UAAC installed, run `gem install cf-uaac` in a terminal window.

The following steps describe how to use UAAC to add users to the Internal User Store.

### <a id="update-client"></a>Step 1: Admin Client Creation

1. Follow the steps to [create an admin client](configure-apps.html#admin) that can manage users in the Service Plan. Include the following scopes for the client:
	- clients.admin
	- scim.read
	- scim.write
2. Copy the **App ID** and **App Secret**. These will be used as your client ID and client secret.

### <a id="adding-users"></a>Step 2: User Creation

1. Target the auth domain of your SSO service plan. This is the URL you provided when creating a Service Plan in the SSO dashboard.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac target <span>https</span>://YOUR-AUTH-DOMAIN.login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</pre>
1. Fetch the token for your Service Plan admin client created in Step 1.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac token client get ADMIN-CLIENT-ID
Client secret:
</pre>
1. When prompted with `Client secret`, enter the admin client secret from Step 1.
1. Add new users by providing the user's email address, username, and password.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac user add --emails YOUR-USER<span>@</span>EMAIL.COM
User name:  YOUR-USER
Password:  ****
Verify password:  ****
user account successfully added</pre>
1. (Optional) You can also create groups and add users to them.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac group add
Group name:  YOUR-GROUP
  meta
    version: 0
    created: 2016-02-19T23:17:17.000Z

  id: 8725b5fd-8da2-4cfc-89b1-c57048f089c2
  displayname: YOUR-GROUP
</pre>
To add a member to your new group, use the following command.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac member add YOUR-GROUP YOUR-USER</pre>

## <a id='passwd-policy'></a> Define Password Policy for the Internal User Store

Administrators can define the password policy for SSO users that are stored in the Internal User Store. The Internal User Store password policy allows you to define and enforce password rules to manage the kind of passwords users can create.

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your UAA administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

2. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown menu.

3. Click **Internal User Store**.

4. Configure the following under the **Password Complexity** section:
    * **Min Length**: Specify the minimum password length.
    * **Uppercase**: Specify the minimum number of uppercase characters required in a password.
    * **Lowercase**: Specify the minimum number of lowercase characters required in a password.
    * **Special Characters**: Specify the minimum number of special characters required in a password.
    * **Numerals**: Specify the minimum number of numeric characters required in a password.

5. Configure the following under the **Lockout Policy** section:
    * **Failures Allowed**: Specify the number of failed login attempts allowed per hour before a user is locked out.
    * **Lockout Period**: Specify the number of seconds a user is locked out for after excessive failed login attempts.
    * **Password Expires**: Specify the number of months passwords are valid for before users needs to enter a new password.

6. Click **Save Identity Provider**.

## <a id='config-sp-saml-settings'></a> Configure Service Provider SAML Settings

For each plan, the Single Sign-On service allows you to configure SAML settings when SAML is used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between the identity provider and the service provider.
The SSO service provides the ability to sign authentication requests and require signed assertions from the external identity provider.

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your UAA administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

2. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown menu.

3. Click **Configure SAML Service Provider**.

4. Configure the following settings:
	* **Perform signed authentication requests**: The service provider signs requests sent to the external identity provider.
	* **Require signed assertions**: The service provider requires that responses from the external identity provider are signed.

5. Click **Save** to save the SAML configurations.

6. Click **Download Metadata**.

## <a id='config-ext-prov'></a> Add an External Identity Provider

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your UAA administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

2. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown menu.

3. Click **New Identity Provider**.

4. Enter an **Identity Provider Name**.

5. Enter a **Description**. This is displayed to Space Developers when selecting an identity provider for their application.

6. Enter the external identity provider metadata in one of the following ways:
    * Option 1: Provide the **Identity Provider Metadata URL** and click **Fetch Metadata**.
    * Option 2: Click **Upload Identity Provider Metadata** to upload XML metadata that you downloaded from your external identity provider.

1. Configure any **User Attributes** to propagate from the identity provider to the service provider. These attributes can include e-mail addresses, first or last names, or external groups. They will be sent to applications via OpenID Connect tokens issued by the Single Sign-On service.
	* Select a **User Scheme Attribute** from the dropdown menu.
	* Enter a **SAML Attribute Name** with the corresponding attribute from the incoming SAML assertion.

2. Configure any **Custom Attributes** that should be propagated from the identity provider to the service provider. These attributes will be sent to applications via OpenID Connect tokens issued by the Single Sign-On service.
	* Enter a **Custom Attribute Name**.
	* Enter a **SAML Attribute Name** with the corresponding attribute from the incoming SAML assertion.

3. Click **Create Identity Provider** to save the identity provider.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To configure the service provider SAML settings, such as the signing of authentication requests and incoming assertions, click on <strong>Configure SAML Service Provider</strong> on the Identity Providers page.</p>

## <a id='delete-idp'></a> Delete an External Identity Provider

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your UAA administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

## <a id='config-whitelist'></a> Configure Group Whitelist for an External Identity Provider

An administrator can configure groups from an external identity provider to be propagated in the ID token by including the group in the Group Whitelist. This will provide information to the application about the external identity groups that the user belongs to.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>roles</code> scope must be requested by the application and the external group must be listed in the Group Whitelist.</p>

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your UAA administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

2. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown menu.

3. Click **Group Whitelist**.
