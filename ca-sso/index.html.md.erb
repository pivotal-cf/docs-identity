 Layer7 SiteMinder (formally known as CA Single Sign-On) is a Web Access Management system that supports advanced authentication, risk-based security policies, and federated identities. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between Layer7 SiteMinder as the identity provider and the <%= vars.product_full %> as the service provider.

<%= vars.product_short %> supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All <%= vars.product_short %> communication takes place over SSL.
