CA Single Sign-On (formally known as CA SiteMinder) is a Web Access Management system that supports advanced authentication, risk-based security policies, and federated identities. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between CA Single Sign-On as the Identity Provider (IdP) and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry as the Service Provider (SP).

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.
