This topic describes how an administrator can test the connection between SSO and CA Single Sign-On. An administrator can test both service provider and identity provider connections.

## <a id="service-provider"></a>Test Your Service Provider Connection

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.run.pivotal.io` and navigate to the organization and space where your application is located.

2. Under **Services**, locate the service instance of the Single Sign-On (SSO) plan bound to your application. Select the service instance and click **Manage**.

1. Under **Identity Providers**, select the CA Single Sign-On identity provider.

1. Return to Apps Manager and click on the URL below your application to be redirected to the identity provider to authenticate.

## <a id="identity-provider"></a>Test Your Identity Provider Connection

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: SSO does not support identity provider-initiated flow into applications, but it does redirect the user to the User Account and Authentication (UAA) page to select applications assigned to the user.</p>

1. Sign in to CA Single Sign-On.

1. Navigate to your application and click it.

1. You are redirected to the page that lists applications you have access to.

	<%= image_tag '../images/app_list.png' %>

## <a id="sso"></a>Test Your Single Sign-Off

Test single sign-off to ensure that when users log out of the application, they are logged out of CA Single Sign-On as well.

1. Sign in to the sample application. Information about the access and ID token displays, as well as the "What do you want to do?" section.
1. Under "What do you want to do?", click **Log out**.

1. You are logged out and redirected to the CA Single Sign-On login page.
