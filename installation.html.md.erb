## <a id='update'></a>Update SSL and Load Balancer

You must update the SSL certificate for the domains listed below for each plan you create.
Depending on your infrastructure and load balancer, you must also update your
load balancer configuration for the following domains:

* `*.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

* `*.APPS-DOMAIN`

* `*.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

* `*.uaa.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`


## <a id='configure'></a> Configure Application Security Groups

<%= vars.product_short %> requires the following network connections:

* TCP connection to load balancer(s) on port 443
* TCP and UDP connection to Domain Name Servers on port 53
* (Optional) TCP connection to your external identity provider on port 80 or 443

To enable access to <%= vars.product_short %>, you must ensure your
ASG allows access to the load balancers and domain
name servers that provide access to Cloud Controller and UAA.
Optionally, you can configure access to your external identity provider to receive SAML metadata.
For how to set up ASGs, see [Application Security
Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/app-sec-groups.html).
