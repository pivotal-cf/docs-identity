This topic explains how to install Single Sign-On (SSO) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

## <a id='pre-reqs'></a> Prerequisites

* Pivotal Cloud Foundry ([Ops Manager](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) and [Elastic Runtime](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime)) version 1.7 or later.

* SSL Certificates.

* Application Security Groups.

## <a id='install'></a>Install SSO via Ops Manager

1. From [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-identity), select a **Single Sign-On** tile version and download the product release file.

2. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, select the **Import a Product** button to upload the product file.

3. Click the plus sign icon next to the uploaded product to add this product to your staging area.

4. Click on the **Single Sign-On** tile to enter any configurations.

	<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Single Sign-On service tile can only be configured with networks with one subnet. When a network with more than one subnet is configured, you will be not be able to install the tile.</div>

5. Click **Apply Changes** to install the product.

## <a id='update'></a>Update SSL and Load Balancer

You must update the SSL certificate for the domains listed below for each plan you create. Depending on your infrastructure and load balancer, you must also update your load balancer configuration for the following domains:

* `*.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

* `*.APPS-DOMAIN`

* `*.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

* `.uaa.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

## <a id='configure'></a>Configure Application Security Groups

The Single Sign-On service requires the following network connections:

* TCP connection to load balancer(s) on port 443
* TCP and UDP connection to Domain Name Servers on port 53
* (Optional) TCP connection to your external identity provider on port 80 or 443

To enable access to the Single Sign-On service, you must ensure your Application Security Group allows access to the load balancer(s) and domain name servers that provide access to Cloud Controller and UAA. Optionally, you can configure access to your external identity provider to receive SAML metadata. For more details on how to set up application security groups, see the [Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) topic.
