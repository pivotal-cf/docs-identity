This topic explains how to install <%= vars.product_full %>.


## <a id='pre-reqs'></a> Prerequisites

To install <%= vars.product_short %>, you must have:

* [<%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager)

* [<%= vars.app_runtime_full %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime)

* SSL certificates

* Application Security Groups (ASGs)


## <a id='install'></a> Install <%= vars.product_short %> Using <%= vars.ops_manager %>

1. From [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-identity), select
a **<%= vars.product_short %>** tile version and download the product release file.

1. From the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard, select the **Import a Product**
button to upload the product file.

1. Click the **+** icon next to the uploaded product to add this product to your
staging area.

1. Click on the **<%= vars.product_short %>** tile to enter any configurations.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <%= vars.product_short %> Identity Service Broker is
    deployed as an app from a BOSH errand, and has no associated BOSH
    VMs that require selecting a corresponding network. If you are forced to select
    a network during installation, select the <strong>Deployment</strong> network,
    also known as the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> network.</p>

1. (Optional) Click **Property Configurations** to set which buildpack
   <%= vars.product_short %> uses when it pushes its component apps.
   VMware recommends the default `java_buildpack_offline` buildpack.
   Because the component apps are Java-based, you must specify a Java-compatible buildpack.

1. (Optional) Click **Property Configurations** to exposes the UAA issuer URI
   to applications as part of `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
   ![Screenshot of the UAA Issuer configuration.](./images/property-configuration-uaa-issuer-uri.png))

   When the <%= vars.product_short %> has this option configured, checked, the <%= vars.product_short %> will expose
   the UAA Issuer URI in the VCAP services environment variable under the `p-identity.credentials.issuer_uri` value
   adjacent to the `p-identity.credentials.client_id` and `p-identity.credentials.client_secret` values.

   This option is beneficial when the UAA has a custom Issuer URI set. In that scenario,
   the <%= vars.product_short %> portion of the VCAP_SERVICES variable may look like (shortened for clarity):
   ```
   {
     "p-identity": [
     {
       "label": "p-identity",
       ...
       "credentials": {
       ...
       "auth_domain": "https://dev-plan.login.system-domain.com",
       "client_secret": "00cf5e1c-dea3-43af-9b2d-c0ad6319b206",
       "issuer_uri": "https://dev-plan.login.custom-domain.com/oauth/token",
       "client_id": "0402c634-67de-4c0b-bb7d-1be3f7310fab"
       },
       ...
     }]
   }
   ```

1. In the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Dashboard, do the following to complete the installation:

    1. If you are using <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
    For more information about this <%= vars.ops_manager %> page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="stemcell"></a>Update Stemcell

If required, do the following to update the stemcell for <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Download the stemcell from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/).
1. In the <%= vars.ops_manager %>, click **Stemcell Library**.
1. Click **Import Stemcell**, and then select the stemcell you downloaded from
<%= vars.product_network %>.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='update'></a>Update SSL and Load Balancer

You must update the SSL certificate for the domains listed below for each plan you create.
Depending on your infrastructure and load balancer, you must also update your
load balancer configuration for the following domains:

* `*.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

* `*.APPS-DOMAIN`

* `*.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`

* `*.uaa.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`


## <a id='configure'></a> Configure Application Security Groups

<%= vars.product_short %> requires the following network connections:

* TCP connection to load balancer(s) on port 443
* TCP and UDP connection to Domain Name Servers on port 53
* (Optional) TCP connection to your external identity provider on port 80 or 443

To enable access to <%= vars.product_short %>, you must ensure your
ASG allows access to the load balancers and domain
name servers that provide access to Cloud Controller and UAA.
Optionally, you can configure access to your external identity provider to receive SAML metadata.
For how to set up ASGs, see [Application Security
Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/app-sec-groups.html).
