## <a id="identity-provider"></a>Test Your Identity Provider Connection

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <%= vars.product_short %> does not support identity provider-initiated flow into apps, but it does redirect the user to the User Account and Authentication (UAA) page to select apps assigned to the user.</p>

	<%= image_tag '../images/app_list.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

## <a id="sso"></a>Test Your Single Sign-Off

1. Under **What do you want to do?**, click **Log out**.
