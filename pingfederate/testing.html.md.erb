## <a id="identity-provider"></a>Test Your Identity Provider Connection

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: SSO does not support identity provider-initiated flow into applications, but it does redirect the user to the User Account and Authentication (UAA) page to select applications assigned to the user.</p>

1. Sign in to PingFederate.

## <a id="sso"></a>Test Your Single Sign-Off

Test single sign-off to ensure that when users log out of the application, they are logged out of PingFederate as well.

1. Sign into the sample application. Information about the access and ID token displays, as well as the “What do you want to do?” section.
1. Under **What do you want to do?**, click **Log out**.
