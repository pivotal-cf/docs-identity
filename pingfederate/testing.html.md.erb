This topic describes how an administrator can test the connection between SSO and PingFederate. An administrator can test both service provider and identity provider connections.

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` and navigate to the organization and space where your application is located.

2. Under **Services**, locate the service instance of the Single Sign-On (SSO) plan bound to your application. Click the service instance and then click **Manage**.

## <a id="identity-provider"></a>Test Your Identity Provider Connection

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: SSO does not support identity provider-initiated flow into applications, but it does redirect the user to the User Account and Authentication (UAA) page to select applications assigned to the user.</p>

1. Sign in to PingFederate.

	<%= image_tag '../images/pingfederate_sign_in.png' %>

1. Navigate to and click the **Pivotal Cloud Foundry** application tile.

1. View the list of applications you have access to.

## <a id="sso"></a>Test Your Single Sign-Off

Test single sign-off to ensure that when users log out of the application, they are logged out of PingFederate as well.

1. Sign into the sample application. Information about the access and ID token displays, as well as the “What do you want to do?” section.
1. Under **What do you want to do?**, click **Log out**.

1. Ensure that you are logged out and redirected to the PingFederate login page.
