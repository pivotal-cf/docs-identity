PingFederate is a federation server that provides identity management, single sign-on, and API security for the enterprise. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between PingFederate as the Identity Provider (IdP) and <%= vars.product_full %> as the Service Provider (SP).

<%= vars.product_short %> supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All <%= vars.product_short %> communication takes place over SSL.
