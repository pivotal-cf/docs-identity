This topic tells you how Space Developers create an instance of a <%= vars.product_full %> service
plan in their space and bind it to an app.

## <a id='create-svc-instance'></a> Create Service Instances

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.SYSTEM-DOMAIN` as a Space Developer.

2. Navigate to the org that where the service plan is enabled.

3. Select **Marketplace** and select the **<%= vars.product_short %>** service.

4. Select the service plan you want and click **Select this plan**.

5. In the **Configure Instance** box, enter an **Instance Name**.

6. Under **Instance Configuration**, enter a name for your instance in **Instance Name**.

1. From the **Add to Space** drop-down, select a space for the instance.
This space hosts your app.


7. From the **Bind to App** drop-down, select an app to bind the service instance to.
This option defaults to `[do not bind]`. If you do not bind the instance to an app,
you can bind it at a later time.

8. Click **Create** to create the service instance.

## <a id='access-svc-instance-developer-dashboard'></a> Access the <%= vars.developer_dash %>

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.SYSTEM-DOMAIN` as a Space Developer.

2. Navigate to the org and space where the service instance you want to manage is located.

3. Under **Services**, select the service instance you want to manage.

## <a id='delete-svc-instance'></a> Delete Service Instances

3. Click **Services** and then click the **Name** of the service you want to delete.

<p class="note">
<span class="note__title">Note</span> This action cannot be undone.

  as well as the associated service bindings.
  You must bind any apps bound to the deleted service instance to a new service instance.
