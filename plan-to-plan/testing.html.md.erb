This topic describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) administrator can test the OpenID Connect (OIDC) connection between a Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan acting as an Identity Provider (IDP), and another SSO service plan acting as a Relying Party (RP).

## Testing Your SSO Connection

	<li>Log in to Apps Manager at <code>ht<span>tps</span>://apps.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</code>.</li>
	<li>Navigate to the Org and Space where your application is located.</li>
	<li>Locate the service instance of the SSO plan bound to your app.<br />

	<img src="../images/app-route-url.png"></li>
	<li>Log in to the app. You will be redirected to the IDP to authenticate.</li>
	<li>Sign in to the IDP.</li>
	<li>If necessary, authorize the necessary scopes to connect the IDP with your app. If you need to do this, the IDP will prompt you.</li>
	<li>After authorizing the scopes, you should be logged into the app.</li>
</ol>
