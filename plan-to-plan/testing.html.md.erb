This topic describes how an administrator can test the OpenID Connect (OIDC) connection between a <%= vars.product_full %> service plan acting as an Identity Provider (IDP), and another <%= vars.product_short %> service plan acting as a Relying Party (RP).

## Testing Your <%= vars.product_short %> Connection

1.  Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.

1.  Navigate to the org and space where your app is located.

1.  Locate the service instance of the <%= vars.product_short %> plan bound to your app.

1.  Log in to the app. You will be redirected to the IDP to authenticate.

1.  Sign in to the IDP.

1.  If necessary, authorize the necessary scopes to connect the IDP with your app. If you need to do this, the IDP will prompt you.

1.  After authorizing the scopes, you should be logged into the app.
