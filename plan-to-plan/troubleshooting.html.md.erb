This topic explains how to resolve common errors that can arise when you configure a single sign-on partnership between two <%= vars.product_full %> service plans, one acting as an Identity Provider (IDP) and one acting as a Relying Party (RP).

## No link for OIDC, or the Service Provider Login page is blank

### Cause

* The discovery URL is incorrect or unavailable. No link appears on the login page.
* This error can occur if you do not enable **Skip SSL Connection** and the IDP service plan is 
on a <%= vars.platform %> instance that uses a self-signed certificate.

## Authorization Request Error

### Cause

You may have configured your OAuth client ID incorrectly.

## 401 Unauthorized

### Cause

You may have configured your OAuth client secret incorrectly.

## 405 Method Not Allowed

### Cause

* You may have omitted the <code>openid</code> scope in the IDP configuration on the RP service plan.
* You may be requesting the wrong scopes or scopes that are not supported by the other <%= vars.product_full %> plan. Confirm that you are only requesting <code>openid</code> scopes. 

## Cannot determine username with given credentials

### Cause

The username you used may not have a value mapped to it. In the IDP attributes, map the "username" attribute to "username."

## Invalid redirect

### Cause

You may have configured the authorized redirect URI incorrectly. Confirm that your callback URL is entered correctly as an authorized redirect URI for the client configurations on the IDP service plan.
