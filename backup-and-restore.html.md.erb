This topic describes how to back up and restore the Single Sign-On (SSO) service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

To back up and restore the SSO service, use the BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) tool to back up and restore PCF. For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/index.html).

As part of backing up and restoring PCF, BBR also backs up and restores the SSO service tile information. The information is included in the Cloud Controller (CC) and User Account and Authentication (UAA) data of Pivotal Application Service (PAS).
