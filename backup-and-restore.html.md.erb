This topic tells you how to back up and restore <%= vars.product_full %>.

To back up and restore <%= vars.product_short %>,
use the BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) tool to back up and restore your deployment.
For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring Deployments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/index.html).

As part of backing up and restoring your deployment,
BBR also backs up and restores the <%= vars.product_short %> tile information.
The information is included in the Cloud Controller (CC) and User Account and Authentication (UAA)
data of <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>.
