Follow the steps below to test your <%= vars.product_short %> connection.

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.SYSTEM-DOMAIN` and navigate to the org and space where your app is located.

1. Under **Services**, locate the service instance of the <%= vars.product_short %> plan bound to your app.

1. On the identity provider sign-in page, enter your credentials and sign in.

1. If the app prompts for authorization to the necessary scopes, click **Accept**.

    ![Screenshot of Example OIDC Client permissions page. The page states that Example OIDC Client needs permission to Sign you in and read your profile and includes a link to show more details. Below are the "Accept" and "Cancel" buttons.](../images/azure-oidc-accept.png)

1. If you are now logged into your app, your Azure AD OIDC to <%= vars.product_short %> connection works.
