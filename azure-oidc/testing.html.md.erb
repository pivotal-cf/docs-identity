This topic describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) administrator can test the OpenID Connect (OIDC) connection between the Single Sign-On (SSO) service and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` and navigate to the org and space where your application is located.

1. Under **Services**, locate the service instance of the SSO plan bound to your app.
