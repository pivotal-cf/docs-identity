title: Configuring Azure Active Directory as an OIDC Identity Provider
owner: Identity Service
---

This topic describes how to integrate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as an identity provider for
a <%= vars.product_full %> plan, by configuring OpenID Connect (OIDC) in both
<%= vars.product_short %> and Azure AD.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft’s multi-tenant cloud-based directory and identity
management service.
It is one of several identity providers you can use in a <%= vars.product_short %> service plan.

To set up the integration, follow the procedures below:

1. [Set up a Relying Party in Azure AD](#procedure)
1. [Set up the OIDC Identity Provider in <%= vars.product_short %>](#config-sso)


## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

Before you can set up a relying party in Azure AD, you must meet the prerequisites
listed in [Azure Active Directory OIDC Integration Guide Overview](./index.html).


## <a id="procedure"></a> Set Up a Relying Party in Azure AD

Follow the procedures below to set up a relying party in Azure AD.


### <a id="register-an-app"></a> Register a New App

To register a new app:

1. Log in to your Azure account and navigate to **Azure Active Directory** &gt; **App registrations**.

    ![Screenshot of Azure Active Directory. The "App registrations" button in the sub-navigation panel is highlighted.](../images/azure-oidc-app-registrations.png)

1. Select **+** to create a **New application registration**. A configuration pane appears.

    ![Screenshot of the "App registrations" tab. "New application registration", "Endpoints", and "Troubleshoot" buttons are at the top.
    Below is the sentence "To view and manage your registrations for converged applications, please
    visit the Microsoft Application Console."
    Below that is a search field for names or App IDs. Next to it is a dropdown with the option
    "All apps" selected.](../images/azure-oidc-new-app-reg.png)

1. Enter a name of your choice in the **Name** field.

1. Select **Web App/API** from the **Application type** dropdown.

1. Enter the sign-on URL in the **Sign-on URL** field.
You can use the URL for the login portal, if you want. This URL has the following pattern:

    ```
    https://AUTH-DOMAIN.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN
    ```
    For example:

    ![Screenshot of the "Create"
    section. At the top right are "Maximize Window" and "Close" buttons.
    There is a "Name" field that contains the text "Example OIDC Client".
    Below that is an "Application type" dropdown that has the option "Web app / API" selected.
    Below that is a "Sign-on URL" field that contains an example URL.](../images/azure-oidc-app-reg-create.png)


### <a id="generate-secret"></a> Generate a Relying Party OAuth Client Secret

To create a client secret:

1. Use the search bar to find your app registration, and click on its listing in the search results.

    ![Screenshot of the app
    registration section.
    "New application registration", "Endpoints", and "Troubleshoot" buttons are at the top.
    Below is the sentence "To view and manage your registrations for converged applications, please
    visit the Microsoft Application Console."
    Below that is a field that contains the text "OIDC".
    Next to it is a dropdown with the option "All apps" selected.
    Below that are "Display Name", "Application Type", and "Application ID" columns.
    The row below has "Example OIDC Client" as the display name, "Web app / API" as the application
    type, and redacted text as the application ID.](../images/azure-oidc-app-reg-searched.png)

1. <a id="app-id"></a>Record the **Application ID** displayed on the screen.
This is the **Relying Party OAuth Client ID**.

    ![Screenshot of the app registration section.
    The app name "Example OIDC Client" is at the top left.
    "Pin", "Maximize Window", and "Close" buttons at at the top right.
    "Settings", "Manifest", and "Delete" buttons are at the top left.
    In the expanded "Essentials" section there are the app details "Display name", "Application type",
    "Home page", "Application ID", "Object ID", and "Managed application in local directory".
    The application ID and object ID values are both redacted.
    At the bottom right is a button labeled "All settings".](../images/azure-oidc-app-reg-id.png)

1. Open the **Keys** tab.

    ![Screenshot of the "Keys" tab.
    The "Keys" button in the "Settings" sub-navigation panel is highlighted.
    At the top left of the "Keys" section are "Save" and "Discard" buttons.
    The table in the "Keys" section has "Description", "Expires", and "Value" columns.
    Below "Description" is the text "No results".
    Below "No results" is a "Key description" field in the "Description" column, a "Duration" dropdown
    in the "Expires" column, and a text field in the "Value" column that has the placeholder text
    "Value will be displayed on save".](../images/azure-oidc-app-keys.png)

1. Enter a name for the key in the **DESCRIPTION** field.

1. Select a duration appropriate for your security requirements in the **EXPIRES** field.

    ![Screenshot of the "Keys" tab.
    At the top left is the "Keys" title.

1. <a id="key"></a>Click **Save** to generate your key value. This value is the
**Relying Party OAuth Client Secret**. Record this value for later use.

    ![Screenshot of the "Keys" tab.
    At the top left is the "Keys" title.
    Below that are "Save" and "Discard" buttons.
    Below the buttons is the warning "Copy the key value. You won\'t be able to retrieve after you

### <a id="configure-urls"></a> Configure Reply and Endpoint URLs

To create reply and endpoint URLs:

1. Under **Reply URLs**, configure and save the URL using the following pattern:

    ```
    https://AUTH-DOMAIN.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/login/callback/ORIGIN-KEY
    ```

    Where:

    - `AUTH-DOMAIN` is the **Auth Domain** you entered in
    [Create or Edit Service Plans](../manage-service-plans.html#create-svc-plan).
    - `ORIGIN-KEY` is based on the **Identity Provider Name** you set in the
    <%= vars.operator_dash %> in **Set Up OIDC Identity Provider in SSO** as shown below.
    Do not use spaces or uppercase letters in this value.

    <p class="note warning">
      <strong>Warning:</strong> The origin key does not change after it is assigned, even if the
      <strong>Identity Provider Name</strong> is modified.
    </p>

    ![Screenshot of the "Reply URLs" tab.
    The "Reply URLs" button is highlighted in the "Settings" sub-navigation panel.
    At the top left of the "Reply URLs" section are "Save" and "Discard" buttons.
    Below the buttons are two text fields.
    The top field contains an example URL.
    The bottom field is empty.](../images/azure-oidc-reply.png)

1. Identify your **Azure Tenant Name**. One location you can use to help you identify this is the
**App ID URI** which uses the form `https://TENANT-NAME/APPLICATION-ID`.
<br><br>
For example, in the App ID URI `https://tenant.onmicrosoft.com/cj8472j2-d3d2-44b1-a2zf-ro5cd03f9584`,
the Azure Tenant Name is `tenant.onmicrosoft.com`.

    ![Screenshot of the "Properties" tab.
    The "Properties" button is highlighted in the "Settings" sub-navigation panel.
    At the top left of the "Properties" section are "Save" and "Discard" buttons.
    Below the buttons are the fields "Name", "Object ID", "Application ID",
    and "App ID URI", one on top of the other
    Below that is an app logo.
    Below the logo are the fields "Upload new logo", "Home page URL", "Logout URL", and
    "Application type".
    At the bottom are "Yes" and "No" buttons below the text "Multi-tenanted".](../images/azure-oidc-tenant-name.png)

1. <a id="relying"></a>Construct the URL for the OpenID Connect metadata endpoint by replacing
`TENANT-NAME` with your Azure Tenant Name in the following string:
`https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT-NAME/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Example:
`https://login.microsoftonline.com/tenant.onmicrosoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`
<br><br>
Record these values for the [next step](#config-sso), configuring your OpenID Connect identity provider in <%= vars.product_short %>.

    </table>

1. Select `openid` as a scope. You can select additional scopes.

1. Under **Advanced Settings** &gt; **Attribute Mappings (optional)** &gt; **User Attributes**,
select **user_name** as the **User Schema Attribute** and enter `unique_name` as the
**Attribute Name**. This enables <%= vars.product_short %> to identify the authenticated user.

1. (Optional) Configure additional attribute mappings.

1. Click **Create Identity Provider** to save your settings.

1. (Optional) [Enable identity provider discovery](../idp-discovery.html#how-to) for the service plan.
