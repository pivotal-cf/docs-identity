This topic describes how to resolve common errors that arise when configuring a single sign-on partnership between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), OpenID Connect (OIDC), and <%= vars.product_full %>.

<%= image_tag '../images/azure-oidc-bad-request.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

### Explanations

Possible explanations are as follows:

* This is a generic error. Review UAA logs for detailed information.
* This error can occur when the app type is created as **Native**. Ensure you created your client in Azure AD as **Web App/API**.
* This error can occur when a response type other than `code` is used. Ensure you configure the response type to use `code`.
