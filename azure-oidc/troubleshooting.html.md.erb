This topic describes how to resolve common errors that arise when configuring a single sign-on partnership between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), OpenID Connect (OIDC), and <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id='bad-request'></a> Bad Request

### Symptom

You see an error similar to the following screenshot:

<%= image_tag 'azure-oidc-bad-request.png' %>

### Explanations

Possible explanations are as follows:

* This is a generic error. Review UAA logs for detailed information.
* This error can occur when the app type is created as **Native**. Ensure you created your client in Azure AD as **Web App/API**.
* This error can occur when a response type other than `code` is used. Ensure you configure the response type to use `code`.

## <a id='no-username'></a> Cannot determine username from credentials supplied

### Symptom

You see an error similar to the following screenshot:

<%= image_tag 'azure-oidc-no-username.png' %>

Under the identity provider attributes, map the `unique_name` attribute to `username`.

## <a id='address-error'></a> Azure Error for Reply Address

### Symptom

You see an error similar to the following screenshot:

### Symptom

You see an error similar to the following screenshot:

<%= image_tag 'azure-oidc-login-404.png' %>
