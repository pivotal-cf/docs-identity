This topic gives you an overview of <%= vars.product_full %>.

<%= vars.product_short %> is an all-in-one solution for securing access to
apps and APIs on <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>. <%= vars.product_short %> provides support for
native authentication, federated single sign-on, and authorization. Operators
can configure native authentication and federated single sign-on, for example SAML,
to verify the identities of application users. After authentication,
<%= vars.product_short %> uses OAuth 2.0 to secure resources or APIs.

## <a id="sso-overview"></a> About <%= vars.product_short %>

<%= vars.product_short %> enables users to log in through a single sign-on service
and access other apps that are hosted or protected by the service.
This improves security and productivity by removing the need for users to log in to
individual apps.

Developers are responsible for selecting the authentication method for application users.
They can select native authentication provided by the User Account and Authentication (UAA)
or external identity providers. UAA is an open source identity server project under
the Cloud Foundry (CF) foundation that provides identity based security for apps and APIs.

<%= vars.product_short %> supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout.
It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow.
All <%= vars.product_short %> communication takes place over SSL.

## <a id="oauth2"></a> OAuth 2.0 Authorization

After authentication, <%= vars.product_short %> uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization.
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that delegates access to apps
to access resources on behalf of a resource owner.

Developers define resources required by an application bound to a <%= vars.product_short %>
service instance and administrators grant resource permissions.
See the <a href="./config-apps.html">Configuring Applications</a> topic for more details.
