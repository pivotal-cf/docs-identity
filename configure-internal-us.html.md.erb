title: Configuring Internal User Store
owner: Identity Service
---

This topic describes how <%= vars.platform_name %> admins can configure a
<%= vars.product_name %> service plan to manage user access to <%= vars.platform_name %> apps with the internal user store.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

By default, each <%= vars.product_name %> service plan comes with an internal user store, which
natively stores user accounts in a User Account and Authentication (UAA) database.

To manage the internal user store:

1. [Configure the Internal User Store](#config-int-store)
2. [Add Internal Users Using UAAC](#add-to-int)
3. [Test Identity Provider Configurations](#test-id-config)

You can also configure a <%= vars.product_name %> service plan to use an external identity provider to
manage user accounts.
For more information, see [Configuring External Identity Providers](./configure-external-id.html).

## <a id='config-int-store'></a> Configure the Internal User Store

To configure the internal user store:

1. Log in to the **<%= vars.operator_dash %>** at
`https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using your UAA admin credentials.
You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Application Service tile in 
Ops Manager under the **Credentials** tab.

1. Under **Name**, click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown.

1. Under **Name**, click **Internal User Store** and select **Edit Provider** from the dropdown.

1. Under **Email Domains**, enter a comma-separated list of the email domains for service plan.

1. (Optional) Under **Authentication Policy** select one of the following:
	- **Disable Internal Authentication**: This option prevents authentication against the internal user store.
	You must have at least one external identity provider configured.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The login page does not include the <strong>Email</strong>
		and <strong>Password</strong> fields if you select this option.</p>
	- **Disable User Management**: This option prevents all users, including admins,
	from managing internal users.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The login page does not include <strong>Create Account</strong>
		and <strong>Reset Password</strong> links if you select this option.</p>

1. Under **Password Policy Settings**, select **Use Recommended Settings**, **Use Default Settings**,
or enter custom settings in the **Password Complexity** and **Lockout Policy** fields.

1. Click **Save Identity Provider**.

## <a id='add-to-int'></a> Add Internal Users Using UAAC

You can create new internal user accounts with the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC).
You can also use the **Internal Users** admin pane to send invitations to users to enable them to add themselves to the internal user store.
However, you cannot use the admin pane to add users directly.
For information about the admin pane,
see [Manage Users in an Internal User Store](./manage-users.html#internal).

To create new internal user accounts with the UAAC:

1. If you do not already have the UAAC installed,  install the UAAC by running the following command:
		
	```
	gem install cf-uaac
	```

1. Create an admin client that can manage users for the <%= vars.product_name %> service plan with the
following scopes:
	- `clients.admin`
	- `scim.read`
	- `scim.write`

	To create an admin client, see [Create Admin Client](configure-apps/index.html#admin).

1. Record the **App ID** and **App Secret**. These are used as your client ID and client secret.

1. Target the authentication domain of your <%= vars.product_name %> service plan by running the following command:
	
	```
	uaac target https://AUTH-DOMAIN.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN
	```
	Where:
	+ `AUTH-DOMAIN` is the URL you provided when you create your service plan.
	This URL is where users authenticate to access apps.
	+ `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the URL for your <%= vars.platform_name %> system domain. 

1. Obtain an access token for your admin client by running the following command:
	
	```
 	uaac token client get APP-ID
	```
	
	Where `APP-ID` is the **App ID** you recorded in the above step.

1. When prompted for `Client secret`, enter the **App Secret** admin client secret you recorded in the above step.

1. Add new users by running the following command:

	```
	uaac user add --emails USER-EMAIL
	```
	Where `USER-EMAIL` is the email address for the user you are creating.
	
1. When prompted for `User name` and `Password`, enter a username and password for the user you are creating.

1. (Optional) Create a user group and add users to the group by doing the following:
	
	1. Create the user group by running the following command:
		
		```
		uaac group add GROUP-NAME
		```
		Where `GROUP-NAME` is the name of the group you are creating.

	1. Add a member to your new group by running the following command:
 		
		```
 		uaac member add GROUP-NAME USER-NAME
		```
