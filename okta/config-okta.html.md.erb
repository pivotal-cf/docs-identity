This topic describes how to set up Okta as your identity provider by configuring SAML integration in both <%= vars.product_full %> and Okta.

## <a id='pcf'></a> Set up SAML in <%= vars.product_short %>

1. Log into the <%= vars.operator_dash %> at `https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` using
your User Account and Authentication (UAA) administrator credentials.
In your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> tile in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, the **Domain** settings shows your
system domain, and the **Credentials** tab shows the **UAA Admin Credentials**.

1. Select your plan and click **Manage Identity Providers** on the drop-down menu.

1. (Optional) Select **Require signed assertions** to validate the origin of signed responses.

1. Click **Download Metadata** to download the service provider metadata.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Open the downloaded service provider metadata file. You will refer to this file in the [next step](#okta), when you fill in the SAML settings in Okta.

1. Sign in as an Okta administrator.

1. Navigate to your app and click the **Sign On** tab.

1. Under **Settings**, click **Edit**, and select **SAML 2.0**.

1. Click the **General** tab.

1. Under **SAML Settings**, click the **Edit** button followed by the **Next** button.

	<%= image_tag('../images/okta_saml_config.png', :alt => 'The information depicted in this screenshot is described in the step above.') %>

1. In the **SAML Settings** section:
	1. Enter the `AssertionConsumerService Location URL` from your downloaded service provider metadata
	into **Single sign on URL**. <br>
	For example, `https://PORTAL-FQDN/saml/SSO/alias/PORTAL-FQDN`. <br>
	Where `PORTAL-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your login portal.
	The portal FQDN uses the format `AUTH-DOMAIN.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
	You can view the portal FQDN for a plan by logging into the <%= vars.operator_dash %>,
	clicking the name of your plan, and selecting **Edit Plan**.
	1. Enter the FQDN for your login portal into **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**.
	This value is available in the downloaded service provider metadata as the entity ID.
	1. Select a **Name ID format**.
	1. Select an **Application username**.

1. (Optional) To configure single logout:
    1. Click **Show Advanced Settings**.
    1. For **Enable Single Logout**, select **Allow application** to initiate single logout.
    1. Enter the `SingleLogoutService Location URL` from your downloaded service provider metadata into **Single Logout URL**.
    1. Enter your `Auth Domain URL` into **SP Issuer**.
    1. Click **Upload Signature Certificate** to upload the signature certificate from your downloaded service provider metadata. You will need to copy the `X509Certificate` information from the downloaded service provider metadata, and reformat it into a valid certificate file to upload.

1. (Optional) Under **Attribute Statements (Optional)**, specify any attribute statements that you want to map to users in the ID token.

1. (Optional) Under **Group Attribute Statements (Optional)**, specify any group attribute statements that you want to map to users in the ID token. This is a group that users belong to within Okta.

1. Click the **Next** button followed by the **Finish** button.

1. Click **Identity Provider metadata** to download the metadata, or copy and save the link address of the **Identity Provider metadata**. You will need this Okta metadata for the next step, [Configure a <%= vars.product_short %> Service Provider](./config-sso.html).
