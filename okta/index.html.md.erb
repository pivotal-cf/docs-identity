Okta is an enterprise identity management and single sign-on service that integrates with apps
in the cloud, on-premises, or on a mobile device. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between Okta as the identity provider and <%= vars.product_full %> as the service provider.

<%= vars.product_short %> supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All <%= vars.product_short %> communication takes place over SSL.
