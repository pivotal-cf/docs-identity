This topic describes how a Plan Administrator uses
<%= vars.product_full %> to manage user access to <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) apps,
for users with accounts in the internal user store or with external identity providers.

## <a id="internal"></a> Manage Users in an Internal User Store

<%= vars.product_full %> has an **Internal Users** admin pane that lets you manage
user accounts in the internal user store: invite and delete
users, request users to reset their passwords, and update user attributes and permissions.

To open the **Internal Users** pane:

1. Log in to the <%= vars.operator_dash %> at `https://p-identity.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`
using your User Account and Authentication (UAA) admin credentials.
You can find these credentials in your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> tile in <%= vars.ops_manager %> under the **Credentials** tab.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown.

1. Click **Internal User Store** and select **Internal Users** from the dropdown.
This brings you to the admin screen.

From the **Internal Users** pane, you can:

* **Invite users** by clicking **Invite User**, entering their email address, and clicking **Send Invite**.

* **Search existing users** by entering a value into the search bar and clicking **Search**.
Entering a blank value returns all users in the service planâ€™s internal user store.

* **Resend an invite** to an unverified user by selecting the checkbox next to their
username and clicking **Resend Invite**.

* Ask a verified user to **reset their password** by selecting the checkbox next to
their username and clicking **Reset Password**.

* **Delete a user** by selecting the checkbox next to their username and clicking **Delete User**.

* **View information about a user** by clicking their username.

* **Update a user profile** including their **Email**, **First Name**, **Last Name**,
and **Phone Number** by entering the updated values and clicking **Save User**.

* **View user permissions** by clicking the **Permissions** tab.

* **Update user permissions** by selecting the corresponding permissions and clicking **Save User**.


## <a id="external"></a> Manage Users from an External Identity Provider

For each external identity provider that <%= vars.product_short %> connects to,
a users admin pane lets you browse, delete, and update permissions
for user accounts from external identity providers. For example, **Okta SSO Users**.

To open the external identity provider users admin pane:

1. Log in to the <%= vars.operator_dash %> at `https://p-identity.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`
using your User Account and Authentication (UAA) admin credentials.
You can find these credentials in your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile in <%= vars.ops_manager %> under the **Credentials** tab.

1. Click the plan name and select **Manage Identity Providers** from the dropdown.

1. Click the external identity provider you want to manage and select the **Users**
choice for the provider from the dropdown. This brings you to the users admin pane.

From the external identity provider users admin pane, you can:

* **Search** existing users by entering a value into the search bar and clicking **Search**.
Entering a blank value returns all users in the service plan internal user store.

* **Delete a user** by selecting the checkbox next to their username and clicking **Delete User**.

* **View information about a user** by clicking their username.
![User Profile - Verified](images/user_profile_verified.png)

* **View user permissions** by clicking the **Permissions** tab.

* **Update user permissions** by selecting the corresponding permissions and clicking **Save User**.


## <a id="uaac"></a> Manage Users with the UAA CLI

You may also use the UAA CLI, or [UAAC](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac),
to manage users for <%= vars.product_short %>.
You can use this approach to programmatically create new internal users or assign
groups (scopes) to any user (whether internal or external).
These operations require administrative access through an admin client that must
be configured by an admin for the service plan.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
  Clients and Groups for <%= vars.product_short %> should be created directly using
  the <%= vars.operator_dash %> or through app manifest bootstrapping.
  Do not create these through UAAC, as additional metadata is required for their
  usage by <%= vars.product_short %>.
</p>

1. Install the UAA CLI, `uaac`, by running:

    ```
    gem install cf-uaac
    ```

1. Target your service plan by running:

    ```
    uaac target AUTH-DOMAIN.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN
    ```
    Where `AUTH-DOMAIN` is the **Auth Domain** you entered in [Create or Edit Service Plans](./manage-service-plans.html#create-svc-plan).
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac target my-auth-domain.login.example.com
    </pre>

1. Record the **App ID** and **App Secret** from your admin client created by
following the steps in [Create Admin Client](./config-apps.html#admin).
You must give your admin client `scim.read` to read user information.
You can give your admin client either `scim.write` to create users and modify group (scope)
memberships or `scim.create` to only create users.

1. Authenticate and obtain an access token for the admin client for your service plan by running:

    ```
    uaac token client get ADMIN-APP-ID -s ADMIN-APP-SECRET
    ```

    Where:
    * `ADMIN-APP-ID` is your **App ID** and
    * `ADMIN-APP-SECRET` is your **App Secret**.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac token client get MyAdminAppId -s MyAdminAppSecret
    </pre>

    UAAC stores the token in `~/.uaac.yml`.

1. Display the client context by running the following command and  verify that you have the sufficient `scim.write`
or `scim.create` permissions under the `scope` section:

    ```
    uaac context
    ```

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac context

    [1]*[admin]
      client_id: MyAdminAppId
        access_token: aBcdEfg0hIJKlm123.e
        token_type: bearer
        expires_in: 43200
        scope: scim.read scim.write
        jti: 91b3-abcd1233
    </pre>

1. Create a new internal user by running:

    ```
    uaac user add NEW-USERNAME -p NEW-PASSWORD --emails NEW-EMAIL
    ```
    Replace `NEW-USERNAME`, `NEW-PASSWORD`, and `NEW-EMAIL` with appropriate information.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac user add Adam -p newSecretPassword --emails adam<span>@</span>example.com
    </pre>

1. Add any group to any user (internal or external) by running:

    ```
    uaac member add GROUP USERNAME
    ```
    Replace `GROUP` and `USERNAME` with appropriate information.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac member add my-app.my-scope Adam
    </pre>

1. Delete any group from to any user (internal or external).

    ```
    uaac member delete GROUP USERNAME
    ```
    Replace `GROUP` and `USERNAME` with appropriate information.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac member delete my-app.my-scope Adam
    </pre>
