# Guide to using Pivotal Single Sign-On

This is a guide to the Pivotal Single Sign-On service, which enables Pivotal Cloud Foundry users to
authenticate with an external identity provider rather than having to create a new account or re-enter credentials. Single Sign-On grants users centralized access to applications in various spaces, as well as to Ops Manager, Apps Manager, and other Cloud Foundry components.
