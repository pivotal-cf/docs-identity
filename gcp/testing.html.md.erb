## <a id="test-sso"></a>Test Your <%= vars.product_short %> Connection

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://apps.SYSTEM-DOMAIN` and navigate to the org and space where your app is located.

1. Under **Services**, locate the service instance of the <%= vars.product_short %> plan bound to your app.

	<%= image_tag '../images/gcp-appsman-sso.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

1. Select the service instance and click **Manage**.

	<%= image_tag '../images/gcp-appsman-manage.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

1. Under the **Apps** tab, select your app.

	<%= image_tag '../images/gcp-appsman-app.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

1. Under **Identity Providers**, select the GCP identity provider. Remove any other identity providers.

	<%= image_tag '../images/gcp-appsman-ips.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

1. Return to Apps Manager and click the URL listed below your app to access your app.

	<%= image_tag '../images/gcp-appsman-route.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

1. Navigate to your login. You will be redirected to the identity provider to authenticate.

	<%= image_tag '../images/gcp-sample.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

1. On the identity provider sign-in page, enter your credentials and sign in.

	<%= image_tag '../images/gcp-sign-in.png' %><%# Images require alt text that describes the image in detail. %>

1. If the app prompts for authorization to the necessary scopes, click **Authorize**.

If you are now logged in to your app, your GCP OIDC to <%= vars.product_short %> connection works.
