title: Configuring GCP as an OIDC Identity Provider
owner: Identity Service
---

This topic describes how to set up Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as an identity provider for a
<%= vars.product_full %> service plan
by configuring OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration in both <%= vars.product_short %> and GCP.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

To set up the integration, follow the procedures below:

1. [Generate GCP Client Credentials](#gcp-rp)
2. [Set up the OIDC Identity Provider in <%= vars.product_short %>](#gcp-oidc-sso)


## <a id='gcp-rp'></a> Generate GCP Client Credentials

Follow the steps below to generate GCP client credentials:

1. Log in to your GCP console.

1. Under the **Credentials** tab, click **Create credentials** &gt; **OAuth client ID**.

    ![A screenshot of the GCP console.
    There are three side tabs: dashboard, library, and credentials. The credentials
    tab is highlighted and the Credentials pane is showing. On the credentials pane
    the create credentials dropdown has been selected. From the drop-down menu, OAuth Client
    ID is selected.](../images/gcp-create-oauth.png)

1. In the configuration pane that appears, select **Web application** under **Application type** and
enter any **Name**. Under **Restrictions**, leave **Authorized JavaScript Origins** blank and for
**Authorized redirect URIs** enter a redirect URI using the following pattern:

    ```
    https://AUTH-DOMAIN.login.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/login/callback/ORIGIN-KEY
    ```
    Where:

    - `AUTH-DOMAIN` is the **Auth Domain** you entered in
    [Create or Edit Service Plans](../manage-service-plans.html#create-svc-plan).
    - `ORIGIN-KEY` is identical to the **Identity Provider Name** you set later in the
    <%= vars.operator_dash %> in
    [Set Up OIDC Identity Provider in <%= vars.product_short %>](#gcp-oidc-sso), except that it
    cannot include uppercase letters or spaces.

    <p class="note warning">
      <strong>Warning:</strong> The origin key does not change after it is assigned, even if the
      <strong>Identity Provider Name</strong> is modified.
    </p>

    ![A screenshot of the OAuth client configuration pane.
    The available fields have been described in this step. The create and cancel buttons are at
    the bottom of the screen.](../images/gcp-config-oauth.png)

1. Click **Create** and record the **client ID** and **client secret** generated. You enter these
values as your **Relying Party OAuth Client ID** and **Relying Party OAuth Client Secret** in the
<%= vars.operator_dash %> in
[Set Up OIDC Identity Provider in <%= vars.product_short %>](#gcp-oidc-sso) below.

    ![A screenshot of the OAuth client dialog box, which has fields that contain the generated client ID and
    client secret. Both fields have a copy button.](../images/gcp-oauth-keypair.png)


## <a id='gcp-oidc-sso'></a> Set up the OIDC Identity Provider in <%= vars.product_short %>

Follow the steps below to set up the OIDC identity provider in <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Follow steps 1&ndash;6 in [Add an OIDC Provider](../configure-external-id.html#config-ext-oidc).

1. In the **Discovery Endpoint URL** field, enter
`https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

1. Click **Fetch Scopes**.

1. Enter your **Relying Party OAuth Client ID** and **Relying Party OAuth Client Secret** from the
[Generate GCP Client Credentials](#gcp-rp) above.

    <%= image_tag('../images/gcp-oidc-settings.png', :alt => 'Screenshot of OpenID Connect Settings. The checkbox labeled Enable Discovery is selected.' %>

1. Ensure that `openid` and `email` are selected as scopes. You can select additional scopes if you
want.

    <%= image_tag('../images/gcp-scopes.png', :width => "200", :alt => 'Screenshot of a drop-down menu showing open ID and email selected as scopes.' %>

1. Under **Advanced Settings** &gt; **Attribute Mappings (optional)** &gt; **User Attributes**,
select **email** as the **User Schema Attribute** and enter `user_name` as the **Attribute Name**.
This enables <%= vars.product_short %> to identify the authenticated user.

    ![Screenshot of the Attribute & Group Mapping section.
    user underscore name has been selected from the User Schema Attribute drop-down menu.
    The word email has been entered into the Attribute Name text box.](../images/gcp-advanced-settings.png)

1. (Optional) Configure additional attribute mappings.

2. Click **Create Identity Provider** to save your settings.

3. (Optional) [Enable IdP Discovery](../idp-discovery.html#how-to) for the service plan.
