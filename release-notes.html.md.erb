**Release Date: March 29, 2023**

### New Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **UAA Issuer URI exposed in the app's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable:**
The identity service broker can now expose the UAA Issuer URI in the app's `VCAP_SERVICES`
environment variable. This feature is deactivated by default for backwards compatibility.
You can enable it as part of the installation. For more information, see [Install <%= vars.product_short %> Using <%= vars.ops_manager %>](installation.html#install).

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

* **Configuring the `clientAuthInBody` attribute:**
  You can now configure the `clientAuthInBody` attribute using the UI when configuring an OIDC identity
  provider. The checkbox in the UI is labeled `Client Credentials in Request Body`, and indicates that
  during a token request to the external identity provider, the client secret is sent in the body
  of the request.
  For more information, see `client_secret_post` in
  [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, Section 9](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication).
