## <a id="1-7-0"></a> v1.7.0

**Release Date: August 14, 2018**

### <a id="170-features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **Expanded API functionality for identity providers**: Operators can now use the API to configure additional features
on identity providers that are not yet exposed through the SSO dashboard. SSO honors values configured through the
API so that they are retained when using the SSO dashboard.
For more information, see the following sections of [Configuring Identity Providers with UAAC](configure-id-providers-api.html):

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>To learn more about...</th>
            <th>See...</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Enabling Client Auth for OIDC</td>
            <td>
                <a href="configure-id-providers-api.html#enable-client-auth">Enable Client Auth for OIDC</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Skipping SSL validation for SAML</td>
            <td>
                <a href="configure-id-providers-api.html#skip-ssl-saml">Skip SSL validation for SAML</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>


* **Expanded API functionality for clients and users**: Operators can now use the API to configure additional features on
[Clients](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.19.0/index.html#clients)
and [Users](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.19.0/index.html#users).

* **External service keys**: The SSO service broker now supports `cf create-service-key`. For more information, see
  [Managing Service Keys](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/service-keys.html)
  and [Register an External App Using Service Keys](config-apps.html#register-service-keys).

* **JSON bind parameters for client configuration**:
  The SSO service broker now supports passing client configuration on the
  command line for `cf bind-service`.
  For more information, see [Configure SSO Properties with Bind Parameters](config-apps.html#configure_bind_params).
  This is the recommended approach for configuring clients bound to Cloud Foundry apps.

* **Client redirect URI now supports custom schemes**: When configuring a client's redirect URIs, SSO now supports custom
  URI schemes. A common use case is deep-linking for mobile apps.
  For more information, see [Configuring apps](config-apps.html).

* **Single logout for all SSO dashboards with Pivotal Application Service (PAS)**:
  Session state for logouts on SSO dashboards are now synchronized with your UAA session.
  This is done using [uaa-singular](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-singular).
