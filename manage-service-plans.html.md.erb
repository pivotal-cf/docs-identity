This topic describes how Plan Administrators edit Single Sign-On service plans.

Single Sign-On is a multi-tenant service, which enables a deployment to host multiple tenants as service plans. Each service plan can have its own administrators, applications and users. This lets enterprises segregate access by using separate plans. For example, the following tenants might require separate plans:

* Business units and geographical locations

* Employees, consumers, and partners

* Development, staging, and production instances


## <a id='edit-svc-plan'></a> Edit Service Plans

You can use the SSO dashboard to configure service plans at any time. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must first request and gain access to at least one service plan for your organization.</p>

1. Log into the SSO dashboard at `https://p-identity.run.pivotal.io` using your administrator credentials. 

1. Click **YOUR-PLAN** > **Edit Plan** on the SSO dashboard to edit a Single Sign-On service plan.

1. Edit the **Plan Name**.

	<%= image_tag 'images/edit_plan.png' %>

1. Enter a **Description** to appear as a plan feature in the Services Marketplace.

1. Enter an **Instance Name** to appear on the login page and in other user-facing content, such as email communications.

1. Add **Plan Administrators**. These users can view the plan and manage identity providers.

1. Under **Org Visibility**, select which organizations in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment should have access to your Single Sign-On service plan. If you do not select any organizations, the plan will not be available for use and it will not be displayed in the Services Marketplace.

1. Click **Create Plan**. Your new plan appears in the Services Marketplace in the organizations you have selected. Users in those organizations view the plan either in Apps Manager or through the CF CLI by entering `cf marketplace` in a terminal window.

## <a id='delete-svc-plan'></a> Delete Service Plans

1. Log in to the SSO dashboard at https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN using your UAA administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

2. Select the name of the plan you want to delete, and click **Edit Plan** in the dropdown menu.

3. Select **Delete** at the bottom of the page.

4. In the popup that appears, click **Delete Plan** to confirm that you want to delete the plan.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: This action cannot be undone. Deleting a Single Sign-On service plan removes from the SSO database all of the configurations, identity providers, users, application configurations and resources associated with the plan. It also deletes the associated service instances and service bindings. You must rebind any applications bound to the deleted service instances to new service instances.</p>

## <a id='configure-token-policy'></a> Configure Token Policy

_Access tokens_ carry information about users and clients to servers that manage resources. Servers use access tokens to determine whether the client is authorized or not. Access tokens typically have a short-lived expiration time. _Refresh tokens_ carry information necessary to retrieve a new access token after an existing access token expires. Refresh tokens typically have a longer expiration time than access tokens.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Single Sign-On service allows administrators to override the default expiry of access tokens (12 hours) and refresh tokens (30 days) by zone.</p>

1. Log in to the SSO dashboard at https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN using your UAA administrator credentials. You can find these credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

2. Select the name of the plan you would like to configure token policy for, and click **Manage Token Policy** in the dropdown menu.

3. Enter the number of seconds for **Access Token Expiration** or select **Use System Default**.

4. Enter the number of seconds for **Refresh Token Expiration** or select **Use System Default**.

5. Click **Save**.
