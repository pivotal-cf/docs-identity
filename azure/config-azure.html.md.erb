owner: Identity Service
---

This topic tells you how to set up Azure Active Directory (AD) as your identity provider by
configuring SAML integration in both <%= vars.product_full %> and Azure AD.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

To set up Azure AD as your identity provider through SAML integration:

1. [Set up SAML in <%= vars.product_short %>](#pcf)
1. [Set up SAML in Azure AD](#azure)
1. [Set up Claims Mapping](#claims)

## <a id='pcf'></a> Set up SAML in <%= vars.product_short %>

To set up SAML in <%= vars.product_short %>, follow the steps in
[Configure SAML Settings](../configure-external-id.html.md.erb#config-ext-settings).

## <a id='azure'></a> Set up SAML in Azure AD

To set up SAML in Azure AD:

1. Log in to Azure AD as a Global Admin in the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Go to the **Azure Active Directory** tab > **Enterprise application**.

   configurations. For more information, see [Setting up SAML](config-sso.html.md.erb#set-up-saml).

10. Go to the **Users and groups** tab and then click **Add User**.
    Select users or group names from the search box. For example, you can add a group that
    includes all users who can log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> plan.

To set up claims mapping:

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise Applications**.

To enable user attribute mappings:

1. In the **Attributes and Claims** section, click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of the "SAML-based Sign-On" section in the "Azure Active Directory" tab in Azure AD. The "Attributes and Claims" section is shown.](../images/azure-saml-attributes-and-claims.png)

2. Edit the attributes.

3. Pass group membership claims to the app by clicking **Add a group claim**:

   ![Screenshot of the "Group Claims" modal in the "Azure Active Directory" tab in Azure AD. Red boxes frame "Add group claim" and the "All groups" and "Security Groups" options.](../images/azure-saml-attributes-group-claim.png)
