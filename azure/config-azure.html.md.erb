2. To pass group membership claims to the app, do the following:
	1. Click **Manifest**.
	2. Locate `groupMembershipClaims` and set the value to one of the following:
		- `SecurityGroup`. Groups claim will contain identifiers of all security
		groups of which the user is a member.
		- `All`. Groups claim will contain the identifiers of all security
		groups and distribution lists of which the user is a member.
	4. Save the change.

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Groups**.

1. For each group that is used by the <%= vars.product_short %> plan, record the **Object ID**. Azure AD passes the
	Object ID of these groups to the <%= vars.product_short %> plan. For more information, see [Configure Group Permissions](./config-sso.html#config-permissions).
